Wiki of the Soltinent D&amp;D campaign

## Reader Guide

(to be added when I figure this out)

## Submission Guidelines

In order to change any information on the wiki, you need to have a GitHub account, and I need to add you to the list of people who can commit to the repo.

### Submitting new wiki files

You are welcome to add any new information to the wiki. Please keep to the guidelines when adding new files:
- Add wiki files exclusively as .md files. You can find the formatting guidelines for .md files [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Additional information can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Before using some form of formatting, please read the corresponding section of the [formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) carefully. It is possible to format text, create lists or task lists, create links, tables, or even embed images. But it is important to follow the markdown rules carefully.
- There are tags in GitHub, but I haven't figured out how they work yet, sorry. I'll add info about them when I learn more.

### Commits

When you make any changes to the wiki, you have to do what's called a "commit." What it means is that you publish your changes to the wiki for everyone else to see.

Please adhere to these commit guidelines when commiting your files, for the sake of good organisation:
- Don't group several unrelated actions into one commit. When you want to make more changes, split them up into several commits.
- Name your commits so that they adequately describe what you did in your commit. Use English, and begin with a verb in the imperative. Examples:
  - Add Joki's page
  - Correct info about Sylvia
  - Update info about Hyacinthe
  - Add William's portrait
- The description of your commit can contain additional information, such as details of what exactly you added, updated or corrected, or whatever else you please.
- Commit to the main branch, if:
  - You're reasonably certain that your commit will not damage the information on the wiki.
  - Correcting typographical errors
  - Adding information the party agrees is true
  - Adding information about your own character, that you want to share
- You should not commit to the main branch and instead create a new branch and start a pull request, if:
  - The information you're adding is a hypothesis, or isn't certain.
  - You aren't sure whether your addition is correct, in respect to the party's knowledge.
  - You're deleting files or any information from the wiki.
